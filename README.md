# TinyCade_13in
2:3 Scale Arcade Cabinet for retro home consoles + more. Fits 13in CRT televisions or 17in LCD monitors.
I lost count how many hours I put into the design, CAD and building 6+ of these. A 100% handmade arcade was my ultimate goal when
I started teaching my self how to build arcades 10+ years ago.
Please use these plans to build your own and just play some games.
